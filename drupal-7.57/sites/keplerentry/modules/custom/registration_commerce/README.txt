Registration Commerce is a module allowing simple integration between the
Registration module (sometimes called "Entity Registration") and Commerce,
specifically by allowing a Commerce transaction to be attached to a Registration
workflow.

Registration Commerce is an inverted version of the Commerce Registration
module, which wants to attach a Registration to a Commerce Product, requiring
a Commerce transaction to be started before a Registration can be created. This
module takes a different approach, allowing Registrations in specified states to
be "paid" by triggering creation of a line item in a user's cart. Once paid, a
Rule can be used to update the status of the original Registration.

# Requirements
Registration Commerce requires Registration and Commerce modules be installed.

# Configuration
1. Download and enable the module.
2. Create or Edit a Registration Type, and visit the Registration Commerce
Settings tab.
3. Enable at least one Registration State for Commerce.
4. You can also set a default registration price here, or specify a "Price"
field on the Registration's parent entity (ie. the Event node) from which to
get the price. For more complex pricing schemes, implement
hook_registration_commerce_calculate_price($data, $info), returning a price
array with 2 indexes: 'amount' and 'currency_code'.
5. Enable the "Complete Registrations on Cart Checkout" Rule, or create your
own Rule triggered on "Completing the Checkout Process" which performs the
action "Set state for all registrations in an order" to set your registrations
to the appropriate state once they are paid.

Now view a registration which belongs to your account and which is in one of the
enabled states. You should see a link to pay for this item.

Note that if a registration is created in a payable state, the creator will be
automatically sent to their cart with the registration line item added.

# Permissions
1. "Administer Registration Commerce" - Allows access to the Registration
Commerce Settings tab on Registration Types.
2. "Pay for any registration product" - Lets users add any Registration to their
cart regardless of who the Registration belongs to or is for, simply by
accessing registration/%entity_id/pay. This is useful for allowing a registrant
to refer the payment to their employer, for example.

# Rules
Registration Commerce adds a couple of rules and rules conditions/actions. Most
important is the "Set state for all registrations in an order" action which
appears in the "Registration" section. Triggering this action on order
completion is a fundamental part of the intended Registration Commerce workflow.
